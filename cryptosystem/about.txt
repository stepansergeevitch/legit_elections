This is the Paillier Cryptosystem implementation.
This system has a homomorphic property.
To demonstrate the property let's consider the following example:

Let E(x) and D(x) be the encryption and decryption of x respectively.
Let operator * for encrypted values correspond to + for unencrypted values.
Then, encryption is called homomorphic if for any two unencrypted x1 and x2 follows:
D(E(x1) * E(x2)) = x1 + x2

Along with basic encryption/decryption mechanisms we implement several basic operators in encrypted domain, such as:
1. Encrypted addition.
2. Encrypted multiplication.
3. Encrypted "greater than".
4. Encrypted bit extraction.

Please, refer to the following paper for the overview of the implementation:

Our implementation slightly differs from the described above and is more standard for Paillier Cryptosystem.
